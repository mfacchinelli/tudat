This error report was generated because the unit test for the
conversion of mean to eccentric anomaly has failed in one of the
random tests. To ensure the data for which it failed is not lost,
the corresponding input variables for these cases are listed below.
Please report a bug on the Tudat website (tudat.tudelft.nl), with
these values, so that someone will look into it and the code can be
improved.
